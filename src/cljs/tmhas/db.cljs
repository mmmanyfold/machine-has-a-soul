   :about-panel    {:aboutSections [{:sectionTitle "About Auraria PB", :sectionContent "Auraria Participatory Budgeting is a new tri-institutional group led by students from all three Auraria institutions aimed at supporting democracy, student voice, and collaboration on campus by engaging students and the broader campus community in a process known as participatory budgeting (or \"PB\") - a method by which communities can democratically decide how to spend shared money. We won a grant that allows us to spend $30,000 using PB at Auraria this year, and we are launching the first-ever student PB process in Denver! \n\nThe idea of the participatory budgeting process is to promote democracy, student leadership, and campus-wide collaboration by implementing an equitable, democratic voting process with real money. We start by canvassing the campus to seek out as many ideas for how to spend the $30K from as many Aurarians as possible. After ideas are collected, we will sort them and develop them into concrete proposals with actual price tags. Then, students will be able to vote for which ones they think are best - the winning proposals will get funded and implemented! We hope to fund two to five projects this year.\n\nVisit [aurariapb.org](https://aurariapb.org/) for more info.\n\n[![fb](//images.ctfassets.net/1xeolmvll2k7/2GlXL1cle8sukI8MasSqcC/89afb3b1e4a7bd31e40b720a0ec74902/fb.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/aurariaPB)\n[![ig](//images.ctfassets.net/1xeolmvll2k7/yaO06NOM24eWowmKgcu2C/133633fca90a303c9c577631122575fa/ig.svg)](https://www.instagram.com/aurariapb/)", :sectionOrder 1} {:sectionTitle "About Cole Has a Soul", :sectionContent "### __CHAS Rulebook:__ [English](//assets.ctfassets.net/0gtzstczow4j/cXG9RNR876YGUa668igK0/86e89ac49ff2519fabfff32e57c794cf/CHAS_RuleBook-final.pdf) / [Español](//assets.ctfassets.net/0gtzstczow4j/12dU2n3AlmECuCA8squ2oW/f9e143167f73e0575c9ad88da10c71cd/CHAS_RuleBook-SP-final.pdf)", :sectionOrder 2} {:sectionTitle "Contact", :sectionContent "For more information, please contact our Program Coordinator, Jenette Preciado at [jenette@warmcookiesoftherevolution.com](mailto:jenette@warmcookiesoftherevolution.com).", :sectionOrder 4} {:sectionTitle "About TMHAS", :sectionContent "*This Machine has a Soul!* is a community project that combines participatory budgeting with artworks and performances inspired by Rube Goldberg machines.\n\nYou might be asking what one has to do with the other. Well, a Rube Goldberg machine takes a simple process and complicates it in a fun way. Designing budgets that allocate public funds is a complicated process involving countless people, interests, and systems. A Rube Goldberg machine is a perfect metaphor for the budgeting process and allows us to explore its themes of complexity and simplicity. More than this, the artwork they inspire serves as a fun and engaging entry point for discussions about the current model of local budgeting as it compares to participatory budgeting.\n\nParticipatory budgeting (PB) offers an alternative to the traditional model by giving a community a portion of public funds to spend on projects in their neighborhoods at their discretion. Communities come together to propose ideas for using funds to improve their neighborhoods, design project proposals, and host a vote to decide which projects are implemented. In a nutshell: PB gives citizens more than a voice in the decision-making process; it gives them real decision-making power over real money and puts the soul back into the machine.\n\n*This Machine has a Soul!* is committed to bringing participatory budgeting to Denver by piloting two PB processes in District 9 with voting taking place by December 2018. Project Belay and resident leaders from the Cole neighborhood, will lead a pb process anchored in Cole and supported by participants who live, work, or attend school there. Students from Community College of Denver, Metropolitan State University of Denver, and University of Colorado, Denver will lead a PB process on the Auraria campus with the help Project VOYCE staff, a local non-profit working with Denver youth to encourage civic engagement and action. Participants in each PB process will design and vote on project proposals that decide how $30,000 will be invested in their communities. Civic health club Warm Cookies of the Revolution along with other local artists will design artworks and performances that support the work of resident leaders and the PB process, and stir the imagination of District 9 residents, spurring artistic collaboration and civic action.\n\n*This Machine has a Soul!* is generously funded by grants from ArtPlace America; Arts in Society with the support of the Bonfils-Staton Foundation, Hemera Foundation, and Colorado Creative Industries; and Colorado Art Tank with the support of Denver Arts and Venues and Denver Foundation’s Arts Affinity Group.\n\n![ArtPlace MAP OCD trans-520x337](//images.contentful.com/1xeolmvll2k7/bkvZI86NWw88WqyEWewSQ/da487b51b340b05d2e9e911b7fe35f33/ArtPlace_MAP_OCD_trans-520x337.png) ![denver arts in society logo](//images.contentful.com/1xeolmvll2k7/2j5gnK71O4mwOQKgIOk4uG/8b2100c2610f4e60d0162a89f00e6881/denver_arts_in_society_logo.png) ![TDF AAG vertical color](//images.contentful.com/1xeolmvll2k7/1DdzyjCAckosmuqsIiwuAa/9ec39118e3b0b1d74c6096a9a806b96e/TDF_AAG_vertical_color.png)", :sectionOrder 3}]}})
